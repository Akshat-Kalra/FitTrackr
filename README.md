**Why is this project of interest to you?**

- I have used workout trackers and TDEE/BMI calculators in the past, but all
of these tools are scattered over the web and their is no such application
that can do it all.
- Also, most of the fitness trackers I have used provide the same basic functionalities
and keep the rest of them behind a paywall.
- I also wanted to make a tracker that can track fitness volume and shows the trends
over time, which can essentially show progressive overload and ensure muscle hypertrophy.

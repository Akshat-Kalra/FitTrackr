# FitTrackr

## About the Application

**What will the application do?**
- This application is a **comprehensive health and fitness companion**. 

- The application will store user workouts including exercises, sets, reps
and weight lifted. The application will also calculate the total workout volume and will store it as well.
- The application will also let the user see their previous workouts and the total volume they performed in that workout.

**Who will use it?**

- This application will be used by people who are into fitness and like
to scientifically optimize their workouts and log their progress.


**Why is this project of interest to you?**

- I have used workout trackers in the past, but all
of these tools are scattered over the web and there is no such application
that can do it all.
- Also, most of the fitness trackers I have used provide the same basic functionalities
and keep the rest of them behind a paywall.
- I also wanted to make a tracker that can track fitness volume over time, which can essentially show progressive overload and ensure muscle hypertrophy.

## User Stories
